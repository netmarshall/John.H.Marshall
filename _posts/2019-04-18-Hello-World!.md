"Hello World" may be a cliche, but with the finish line for high school in sight, and college on the near horizan, it seems pretty on point. This blog is still on training wheels, so I will leave the template content below...I'm still learning GitHub and how to use this awesome Minimal Mistakes theme, so I may actually need it!

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
