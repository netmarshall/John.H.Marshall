The [Media Gallery](https://netmarshall.github.io/John.H.Marshall/gallery/) has 200+ photos from 20+ productions. It would be **crazy** to try to embed each photo individually (and a nightmare to maintain). After a bit of searching, we found a solution that works using Google Photos Albums, and a web viewer from [publicalbum.org](https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embedding-google-photos-albums). 

The web viewer is great, and lets people scroll (or swipe) through each show, and also expands to fill the browser window or even full screen. It also supports automated slide shows (with or without looping) as well as downloads.

The link above walks you through how to do it (just three steps), but the first job is to upload all your photos to Google Photos (if you aren't already using them for managing photos) and sort them into Albums by show. Then it is as easy, as 1-2-3 and you drop the code from publicalbum.org into your web page. 

The Media Gallery relies primarily on show photos, and is sadly limitted to just a few videos that are approved for public distribution (or are original works). I am not a lawyer, but as an artist, I do have to support and champion copyrights. I do have some great videos of my work that can be viewed privately should the need arise.
