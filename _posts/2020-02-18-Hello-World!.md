"Hello World" may be a cliche, but with the finish line for high school in sight, and college just over the horizan, it seems pretty on point. So, to sum up, this is just the start with a lot more to come! 

In the mean time if you like this site shoot me an email, or follow me on Twitter or Instagram. 

I am still learing about GitHub, but if you are curious about this site, it is hosted for free (really, 100% free), and is built using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme (also 100% free).
