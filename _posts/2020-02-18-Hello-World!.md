"Hello World" may be a cliche, but with the finish line for high school in sight, and college just over the horizon, it seems pretty on point. I still have my blogging training wheels on, and there are a few miles left to go in High School (last shows to perform, finals to take, and a walk across the graduation stage). So, suffice it to say: this is just the start with a lot more to come! 

In the mean time if you like this site shoot me an email, or follow me on Twitter or Instagram. 

I am still learing about GitHub, but if you are curious about this site, it is hosted for free (really, 100% free) in GitHub Pages, and is built using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme (also 100% free).
